# Persa

I was bored, and needed to get back to coding actively - so I decided to make a small project in C++ and SQLite. Persa is a simple personal finance tracker that runs on the command line.

## Features

- add, edit, and delete transactions (only adding works atm)
- create repeating transactions (in and out)
- view all transactions
- report on transactions for a duration of time
